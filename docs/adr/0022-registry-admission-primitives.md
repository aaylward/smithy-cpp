# ADR-0022: Registry admission primitives — ResumeOrAdd and Close

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-21). Issue #122, the promotion the ADR-0020
and ADR-0021 review panels twice deferred. Implemented:
`SessionRegistry::{Admission, ResumeOrAdd, Close}`, the three example
admission loops deleted, the production guide's canonical block replaced
by the one call.

## Context

ADR-0020 documented reconnect admission as a recipe: Resume first, fresh
Add second, retried briefly because a reconnect can beat the old wire's
failure notice — for a beat the id looks live to both paths, and the
race is registry-inherent, not application protocol. By ADR-0021 the
recipe had three verbatim in-repo copies (the async hub and both
consumer reconnect mains) plus a canonical block in the production
guide, and the promotion trigger the panels named — the rule-of-three
met on a loop consumers will copy and mis-retype — had fired. The same
reviews named the recipe's dead end: when the refusal is wrong (a
half-dead session whose wire sent no FIN), the application had no
primitive to kick the live entry, so the retry loop only converged when
the old wire's failure was eventually observed.

## Decision

**`ResumeOrAdd(id, mint, deadline) -> Admission`.** The recipe as a
method: per attempt, `Resume` then `Add`; between attempts, a short
sleep; `kRefused` only once `deadline` is spent (a zero deadline is the
single-shot form). `mint` is a handle *factory* — each attempt needs a
fresh `Share()`. Callers get the three-way `Admission` outcome because
every consumer branches on it: `kResumed` replays the snapshot,
`kAdded` announces the join, `kRefused` sends the collision refusal.
The method **blocks**, and the contract rides the doc comment where the
panels insisted it live: call it before a handler's first suspension —
on the launching thread, where brief blocking is fine — never from a
completion context. That contract is prose because it cannot be a type;
relocating the loop does not relocate the constraint, only states it
once instead of three times.

**`Close(id) -> bool`.** The kick primitive the refusal branch was
missing: closes the id's current session — the handle copy is taken
under the entry lock (the Resume-swap discipline, ADR-0020's panel
round) and closed outside all locks. The session's handler observes the
close and runs its normal exit path, leaving the id admittable on the
next dial: freed outright after a Remove exit, parked-resumable after a
Detach exit (where the redial's ResumeOrAdd reports kResumed and the
snapshot carries the identity across).
Policy stays with the application: `ResumeOrAdd` never kicks on its
own, and the chat examples deliberately keep refusing name collisions
rather than kicking — `Close` exists so an application that *knows* the
old session is dead (a silent partition, an operator action) has a
convergent path instead of waiting out TCP. On a detached entry it
closes an already-closed handle: a harmless no-op — detached entries
are `Resume`'s and `Remove`'s business.

## Non-goals

An async admission shape (`co_await ResumeOrAdd`) — admission runs
pre-first-suspend by design, where blocking is legal and cheap; an
awaitable variant would invite admission from completion contexts, the
exact misuse the contract forbids. Auto-kick policies (kick-on-timeout,
takeover tokens): application protocol, per ADR-0020's posture.
Changing `Resume`/`Add` themselves: the primitives compose unchanged.

## Consequences

Consumers write one call and branch on the enum; the retry cadence and
ordering subtleties live (and are tested) in exactly one place. The
guide teaches the call instead of the loop. The silent-partition story
gains its missing move. The registry's public surface grows two
methods and one enum, all shallow compositions of existing primitives —
no new locking, no new threads, no new states.
